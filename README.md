📋 Description:
LasTen is a small news-feed app built to practice working with APIs. The main screen shows a short animation and a table of the latest U.S. 
news loaded from an external API. Tapping an article opens an in-app browser where the full content can be read. The project uses the MVC architecture, 
with data, logic, and UI clearly separated. AI was used only for guidance on structure and API logic — all code was written manually 
to fully understand every part of the implementation.
